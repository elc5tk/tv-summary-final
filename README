This Twitter bot was make to tweet summaries of TV show episodes to twitter users who tweet at the bot. The information for the bot 
was sourced from the TV Maze public API (https://www.tvmaze.com/api#show-cast). 

In order to use the bot tweets must be formatted in one of a few ways. 

Each tweet must include the word 'summary', the TV show title, the season, and the episode in that order. The bot is connected to a twitter
account with the username @emcath7. 

The following tweets are sample tweets with wording that will recieve a response from the bot. 

Sample tweets:

    @emcath7 Hello! Can I have a summary of Modern Family season 1 episode 1

    @emcath7 summary Modern Family season 1 episode 1

    @emcath7 summary of Modern Family season 1 episode 1

    @emcath7 summary Modern Family season 1 episode 1 please

Each of the tweets above would recieve the following reply: "@UserWhoSentTweet A new half-hour comedy that takes an honest 
and often hilarious look at the complexities of modern day families."


The bot also responds to tweets that ask about TV shows, episodes, or seasons that do not exist. 

Sample tweets for non existant shows/episodes:

    @emcath7 Hello! Can I have a summary of Table season 1 episode 1

        Response:
        @UserWhoSentTweet Sorry! We don't have that show or we don't understand what you are asking. Please try again!

    @emcath7 summary Modern Family season 100 episode 1

        Response:
        @UserWhoSentTweet Sorry! That episode or season might not exist or we don't understand what you are asking. Please try again!

Some episode summaries are longer than the 270 character limit for tweets. In order to account for this summaries that are longer than 
260 characters (leaving 10 characters to account for usernames) are broken up into two or three tweets based on their lengths. 

The reply_to_tweets() function - which looks for and responds to tweets - runs every 30 seconds to see if there are any twitter users who 
have asked for. In order to track which tweets have been responded to and which tweets are awaiting a response the last_seen_id.txt file 
keeps track of the ID of the last tweet that the bot replied to in order to make sure that each tweet is replied to in order. The bulk of 
the code in the reply_to_tweets() function parses the text of the tweets to figure out which TV show, season, and episode the user is 
interested in. That is why the phrasing of the tweets (acceptable phrasings shown in examples above) is so important.
